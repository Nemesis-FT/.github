# Contributing

Hello, and thanks for taking an interest in contributing to one of my repositories!

If you want to contribute code, I'd be glad to receive a **pull request** from you on GitHub!

If you live in a country [where you cannot access](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-and-trade-controls) GitHub, please send me [the patch files](https://gist.github.com/deanrather/44bf0d4988730ecf1e7d) via [email](mailto:ste.pigozzi@gmail.com).
