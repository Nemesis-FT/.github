# Contributing code

Hi!

Thanks for taking an interest in this project, and possibly also the time and resources to contribute to it!

Code can be contributed via:

* the GitHub flow of [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) the repository, editing it, and creating a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
* the Git flow of sending me an [email](mailto:me@steffo.eu) containing a [pull request](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull)

Try to keep the commit history clean: the better the commit messages, the less time it will take for me to review your pull request!

If I forget to review something (which may sometimes happen, sorry), do not be afraid to message me again as a reminder!
