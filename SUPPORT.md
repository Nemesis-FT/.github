# Support

Hi!

If you found a bug, have a feature request, or just a question about one of my repositories, feel free to **open a new issue** on GitHub!

If you live in a country [where you cannot access](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-and-trade-controls) GitHub, please send me [an email](mailto:ste.pigozzi@gmail.com), and I'll try to answer as soon as possible.
