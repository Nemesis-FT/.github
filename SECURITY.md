# Security

Hi! 

Thanks for taking the time to report a security vulnerability in this repository!

Please **DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE ABOUT IT**, as that would make the issue immediately public, and either [create a security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) (if you have commit access to repository) or send me an email at [me@steffo.eu](mailto:me@steffo.eu) so I can create one on your behalf.
