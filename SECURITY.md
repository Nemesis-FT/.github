# Security

Hi! Thanks for reporting a security vulnerability in one of my repositories!

If you found a security problem in one of them, please **DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE ABOUT IT** and either [create a security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) (if you have commit access to repository) or send me an email at [ste.pigozzi@gmail.com](mailto:ste.pigozzi@gmail.com) or [me@steffo.eu](mailto:me@steffo.eu) so I can create one for you.
