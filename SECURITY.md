# Security

Hi! Thanks for checking the security of my repositories!

If you found a security problem in one of them, please **avoid creating an issue** and either [create a security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) (if you have commit access to repository) or [send me an email](mailto:ste.pigozzi@gmail.com) so I can create one and add you as a collaborator.
